# Welcome

Hello and welcome to my blog! I created this blog so that I can put my thoughts and experiences in programming and other life stuff.
I am currently working in a Developer Experience team in a large-scale company, and am pretty excited about the cutting-edge tech
I get to tinker around with or even created myself. I am also starting out in cooking, so I might post articles about that topic as well.

Hope you like it!
